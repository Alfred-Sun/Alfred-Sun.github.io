# This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
