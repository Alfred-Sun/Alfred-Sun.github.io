My Geek Code Explained

The Geek Code is a perhaps a little silly in-joke among geeks; a way of introducing yourself to another geek by how you score on different geeky things, such as Star Trek or programming tools.

What follows is my geek code:

-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----

Here it is in expanded and explained form with some comments by me (marked with “MC”):

[on my blog](https://kaworu.ch) and all Octopress themes were based on
Bootstrap 2.x.-->
