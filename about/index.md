	I go by the blog name "Vermillion Phoinix", and usually have more to say than anyone ever cares to hear about.			-- <b>Alfred Sun</b>

<!--**Octostrap3** started because I really wanted to use Bootstrap while posting
[on my blog](https://kaworu.ch) and all Octopress themes were based on
Bootstrap 2.x.-->
