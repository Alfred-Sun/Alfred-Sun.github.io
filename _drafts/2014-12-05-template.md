<img src="{{ site.picture_dir }}/8580803186_ccf9d4337b_o.png" width="50%" align="right">I'm very excited to let you know that I'm joining [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/).

After two years at Facebook I couldn't be more proud. Proud to have been part of something as important as Facebook and proud of the work I've done with shaping the future of mobile communication. It's truly been a fantastic time of my life - an experience rich of great people, mind-boggling challenges and once-in-a-lifetime experiences.

> Look at the past for inspiration, but focus on the future, because tomorrow is shaped by the choices we make today.

At Dropbox I'm going to work hard to make all our lives better. Remove friction from technical details in our modern daily lives, and relieve us from worrying about our "stuff" - from quick snapshots and hasty notes to precious memories.
